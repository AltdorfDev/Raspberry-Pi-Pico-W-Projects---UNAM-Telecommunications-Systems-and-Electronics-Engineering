# Raspberry-Pi-Pico-W-Projects---UNAM-Telecommunications-Systems-and-Electronics-Engineering
This repository is a collection of my hands-on activities and projects with the Raspberry Pi Pico W, developed as part of my studies in Telecommunications, Systems, and Electronics Engineering at UNAM. Itâ€™s designed to help me practice and deepen my understanding of embedded systems, IoT applications, signal processing, and communication protocols.

Each project includes:

Clear documentation: Step-by-step instructions, schematics, and explanations to make concepts easier to grasp.
Organized code samples: Well-documented code using the Raspberry Pi Pico W SDK, covering I2C, SPI, UART, and GPIO functionalities.
Practical applications: Each activity reflects real-world scenarios, connecting theory to practice.
This repository is a personal resource for anyone looking to learn and experiment with embedded systems and digital electronics using the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
